To install the extension, download the zipped file and extract the files onto your desktop. Open up the Chrome browser and open up the settings and click More Tools->Extension, enable developer mode, and click on "load unpacked extension". The only folder you will need to upload is called "extension" which is inside the folder you extracted and will contain everything necessary to run the extension.
