# Google Chrome Extension :computer:
## Software Design and Development Final Project

This project was developed by Kayla Johnson (kjohnson12@carthage.edu), Dan Gerloff (dgerloff@carthage.edu), Mario Del Real (mdelreal2@carthage.edu ) and Dimitrije Kastratovic as a Final Project for our Software Design And Development class

As the caption already says, this is a Google Chrome Extension, that anybody can use in their browser with ease. The extension itself is supposed to make reading less stressful, by allowing user to select particular text and increase readability by modifying the text according to his/her needs. There also an option that allows user to speed read the selected text by setting the desired word per minute speed.

To install the extension,you first need to download the zipped file and extract the files onto your desktop. Open up the Chrome browser and open up the settings by clicking on three dots in the top right corner, and click More Tools->Extension, enable developer mode, and click on "load unpacked extension". The only folder you will need to upload is called "extension" which is inside the folder you extracted and will contain everything necessary to run the extension.
