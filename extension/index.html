<!-- Tip to get element id's and other data when writing functionality
Because everything will be created dynamically through js, and won't leave a neat structure
like HTML code does, it is noticeably harder to see all the different components
of all the items on an HTML page. The easiest way I've found to obtain element id's and such
is by running the code and opening the DOM Explorer by pressing F12 in the browser. 
For sure on Edge and Chrome, there is a button in the top left corner of the DOM Explorer that you can
use to click on an element and it will show everything about that element.
